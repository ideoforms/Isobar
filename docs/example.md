!!! tip "Installation in a virtual environment"

    The best way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and
    without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a **virtual
    environment**. Don't know what this is or how to set it up? We recommend
    to start by reading a [tutorial on virtual environments][6] for Python.

!!! warning "Installation on macOS"

    When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, `pip`
    tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have
    the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this:

=== "Unix"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```
