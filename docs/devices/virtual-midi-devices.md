# Virtual MIDI Devices

To send MIDI events to audio software running on the same computer (for example, to use isobar-ext to trigger events in your DAW), you will generally need to set up a *virtual MIDI driver*. This lets you send MIDI messages between different applications.

For cross-platform instructions on how to do this, see [Setting up a virtual MIDI bus](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-How-to-setup-a-virtual-MIDI-bus) (Ableton).
